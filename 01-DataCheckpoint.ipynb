    "The rapid growth of global plastic production over recent decades has raised increasing concern due to its environmental and climate impacts. Since the 1950s, plastic production has increased from almost zero to hundreds of millions of metric tons per year, largely driven by industrialization and rising consumer demand [1]. Because most plastics are produced from fossil fuels, their manufacturing and disposal require large amounts of energy and result in greenhouse gas emissions. As a result, plastic production is closely connected to broader patterns of fossil fuel use and industrial activity.\n",
    "Long-term observations show that atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO₂) concentrations have risen steadily since the late 1950s. Measurements collected by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) indicate that current CO₂ levels are significantly higher than pre-industrial values and continue to increase each year [2]. This rise is mainly caused by the widespread burning of fossil fuels and other human activities, and it is strongly linked to global warming. Increasing CO₂ concentrations are associated with other major climate indicators, including rising global temperature anomalies, reflecting an enhanced greenhouse effect in Earth’s atmosphere.\n",
    "Scientific assessments by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) provide strong evidence that human-driven increases in greenhouse gases have caused widespread warming across the climate system. The IPCC Sixth Assessment Report explains that excess heat trapped by greenhouse gases has been absorbed largely by the oceans since the mid-20th century, leading to accelerating glacier and ice-sheet melt and rising global sea levels [3]. These observed changes closely follow long-term increases in fossil fuel consumption and industrial production, suggesting that other fossil-fuel-intensive activities may exhibit similar relationships with climate indicators.\n",
    "Global temperature records further support this warming trend. Data from NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies show that recent decades are significantly warmer than the mid-20th century average, indicating a clear and persistent rise in global temperature anomalies [4]. Because plastics are derived from fossil fuels and contribute to greenhouse gas emissions throughout their lifecycle, examining the statistical relationship between global plastic production and key climate indicators. Atmospheric CO₂ concentrations and global temperature anomalies can help clarify how industrial production aligns with observed global warming trends.\n"

    "We hypothesize that there is a statistically significant positive correlation between global plastic production levels and indicators of global warming, including atmospheric CO₂ concentration, fossil fuel consumption, and global average temperature anomalies. This relationship is expected because plastic production is highly dependent on fossil fuels and contributes to greenhouse gas emissions throughout its lifecycle. As plastic production increases steadily over time, we anticipate upward trends in the climate variables as well.\n"
